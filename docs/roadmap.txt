Would you like:

Let me know and I‚Äôll build it out.






Hybrid Option (Best of Both)
Use Django for core admin + vendor/order management, and FastAPI for AI/search layer.

Django:

Admin panel for internal ops

User management

Escrow logic

Vendor KYC & orders



FastAPI:

Conversational search API (e.g., ‚Äúred bag under 20k‚Äù)

AI-based product parsing

Social media content ingestion

Async background jobs (Celery or RQ)

This lets you move fast, scale well, and keep the project clean.
