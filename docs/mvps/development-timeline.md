# Development Approach:

For each stage:

Start with core functionality
Add error handling
Write tests
Document the implementation
Testing Strategy:

Unit tests for services
Integration tests for API endpoints
E2E tests for critical flows
Performance testing for scraping
Deployment Strategy:

Set up development environment
Create staging environment
Plan production deployment
Implement monitoring




# Recommended Implementation Order:

Start with Stages 1 & 2 together as they form the basic functional app
Move to Stage 3 for data sourcing
Implement Stage 4 to add intelligence
Add Stage 5 for user features
Finally, implement Stage 6 for monitoring
Success Criteria for MVP:

Users can search using natural language
System returns relevant Instagram products
Basic product display and cart works
Admin can monitor basic metrics
